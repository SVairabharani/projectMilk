                <p>The project was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. Working with both hardware and software components was a unique experience, and required a lot of problem-solving and critical thinking skills. However, seeing the end result and knowing that our project could potentially make a difference in the lives of mothers was very fulfilling.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating the hardware and software components seamlessly. There were times when our team had to pivot and make changes to our design in order to ensure that everything was working together properly. This required good communication and collaboration among team members, and was a valuable learning experience.</p>

                <p>Throughout the project, we had to keep the end user in mind and ensure that our solution was practical and user-friendly. This meant testing and iterating our design multiple times to make sure that it met the needs of our target audience. We also had to consider factors such as safety and hygiene when designing our hardware components.</p>

                <p>Overall, working on this project was a great opportunity to apply our technical skills to a real-world problem. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that taught us a lot about working in a team and overcoming obstacles. We are proud of what we accomplished and hope that our solution can make a positive impact in the lives of breastfeeding mothers.</p>
